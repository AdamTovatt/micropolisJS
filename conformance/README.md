# Conformance data

Data that the TypeScript and C# implementations of the game rules both test against, read from here by each side
rather than copied.

## random.json

Reference vectors for the simulation's random stream, specified in `src/random.ts`. `random.c` writes the file: it
runs the reference C implementations of xoshiro128** 1.1 and SplitMix64 (<https://prng.di.unimi.it/>), with
`getRandom`, `getRandom16Signed`, `getERandom` and `getChance` written in C over the same 16-bit draws as
`random.ts` specifies them. To change or extend the vectors, edit `random.c` and regenerate:

```bash
cc -O2 -o random conformance/random.c && ./random > conformance/random.json
```

- `seeds`: for each seed, the state SplitMix64 fills, the first raw draws, and the state after one `jump()`.
- `getRandom`: from the seed, `callsPerMaximum` calls with each maximum in turn. Some of the draws are rejected, and
  the range of 32767 divides 65536, so the outputs pin the rejection sampling and its 0xffff bound.
- `getRandomAtTheBoundary`: consecutive calls with one maximum. The seed's first 16-bit draw, 57033, equals the largest
  multiple of the range, 57033, so it is rejected; accepting it would give 0.
- `getRandom16Signed`, `getERandom`, `getChance`: consecutive calls from the seed.

Seeds and 32-bit words are hex strings, as the C reference prints them.
